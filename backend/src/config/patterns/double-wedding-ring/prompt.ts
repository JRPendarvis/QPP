  characteristics: `Double Wedding Ring is an iconic curved pattern creating interlocking rings:
- Curved arc bands form continuous interlocking ring chains
- Horizontal rings and vertical rings weave through each other
- Melon shapes form at the corners where rings intersect (complete when tiled)
- Background shows through the ring centers
- One of the most recognizable traditional patterns
- Creates an allover design — rings connect seamlessly across blocks
- Traditionally made with many scrappy fabrics in the arcs`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `Double Wedding Ring fabric assignments (supports 2-8 fabrics):

WITH 2 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): All arc bands (both ring directions) and corner melons
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Ring centers and negative space

WITH 3 FABRICS (recommended):
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Horizontal arc bands and corner melons — one ring direction
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Ring centers and negative space — often white or cream
- COLOR3 (ACCENT): Vertical arc bands — the second ring direction

WITH 4+ FABRICS (scrappy arcs):
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Consistent ring centers across all blocks
- COLOR2-7 (PRIMARY options): Arc segments rotate colors for scrappy variety
- COLOR8 (ACCENT): Melon intersection pieces for consistency

Traditional Double Wedding Ring quilts often use dozens of fabrics in the arcs. With 4-8 fabrics, arc colors rotate across blocks to approximate this scrappy look while maintaining a cohesive background.

High contrast between rings and background makes the interlocking pattern pop.`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Double Wedding Ring cutting specifics:
- Requires curved templates (purchased or custom drafted)
- Cut arc segments for each ring band (typically 4 wedges per quarter-arc)
- Cut melon/football shapes for the intersections
- Cut background pieces for ring centers
- Specialized rulers (e.g., Marti Michell, Accuquilt dies) highly recommended
- For scrappy arcs: cut arc wedges from multiple fabrics`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Double Wedding Ring:
- Advanced pattern requiring curved piecing skills
- Piece arc wedges into quarter-arcs, then half-arcs
- Join arcs to background centers
- Set in melon shapes at ring intersections
- Pin and ease curves carefully — don't stretch
- Foundation paper piecing or freezer paper templates improve accuracy
- For scrappy layouts: randomize arc wedge fabrics within each ring`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Double Wedding Ring mistakes:
- Stretching bias edges on curves (causes puckering and distortion)
- Inaccurate templates (rings won't align when joined)
- Rushing curved seams (take time to pin frequently)
- Pressing curves flat instead of following the curve direction
- Not testing templates on scrap fabric first
- In scrappy versions: placing same fabric in adjacent arc wedges (reduces variety)`
