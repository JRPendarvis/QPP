  characteristics: `Double Wedding Ring is an iconic curved pattern creating interlocking rings:
- Curved arc bands form continuous interlocking ring chains
- Rings weave through each other creating the signature overlapping effect
- Melon/football shapes form at the corners where rings intersect
- Background shows through the ring centers (traditionally white or cream)
- One of the most recognizable and beloved traditional quilt patterns
- Creates an allover design where rings connect seamlessly across blocks
- Requires curved piecing skills and precision for proper ring alignment
- Often made with scrappy fabrics in the pieced arcs for visual interest`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `Double Wedding Ring fabric assignments (supports 3-6 fabrics):

WITH 3 FABRICS (minimum):
- BACKGROUND (fabricColors[0]): Ring centers and negative space
- PRIMARY (fabricColors[1]): First set of ring arcs
- SECONDARY (fabricColors[2]): Second set of ring arcs (alternates with Primary)

The alternating Primary and Secondary arcs create the interlocking ring illusion.

WITH 4 FABRICS (recommended):
- BACKGROUND (fabricColors[0]): Ring centers - traditionally white or cream
- PRIMARY (fabricColors[1]): One set of arc rings
- SECONDARY (fabricColors[2]): Alternating arc rings (creates interlocking effect)
- ACCENT (fabricColors[3]): Corner melon connectors (intersection pieces)

WITH 5-6 FABRICS (scrappy arcs):
- BACKGROUND (fabricColors[0]): Consistent ring centers across all blocks
- PRIMARY (fabricColors[1]): Main arc color
- SECONDARY (fabricColors[2]): Alternating arc color
- ACCENT (fabricColors[3]): Melon connectors
- CONTRAST (fabricColors[4]): Additional arc wedge variation
- ADDITIONAL (fabricColors[5]): More arc wedge variety for scrappy look

Traditional Double Wedding Ring quilts often use dozens of scrappy fabrics in the arcs. 
With 5-6 fabrics, distribute Contrast and Additional colors throughout the pieced arc segments 
to create variety while maintaining the overall ring structure.

DESIGN TIP: Use high contrast between Background and arc colors so the interlocking rings stand out clearly.`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Double Wedding Ring cutting specifics:

BACKGROUND fabric (fabricColors[0]):
- Cut center ring pieces (the "melon background" that shows through)
- These pieces are typically curved squares or modified rectangles
- Requires precise curved template

PRIMARY fabric (fabricColors[1]):
- Cut arc segments (typically 4-5 wedges per quarter-arc)
- Each wedge is a small curved piece

SECONDARY fabric (fabricColors[2]):
- Cut arc segments matching Primary quantity
- These alternate with Primary to create interlocking effect

ACCENT fabric (fabricColors[3]):
- Cut corner melon/football shapes (4 per block)
- These connect the rings at intersection points

CONTRAST/ADDITIONAL fabrics (fabricColors[4-5]):
- Cut extra arc wedges for scrappy variation
- Mix throughout the arc segments

CRITICAL: Use specialized templates or rulers (Marti Michell, Accuquilt dies recommended).
All pieces have curves - accuracy is essential for rings to align when blocks are joined.
Add 1/4" seam allowance to all template pieces.`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Double Wedding Ring:
- This is an ADVANCED pattern requiring curved piecing experience
- Practice on scrap fabric before cutting final pieces

PIECING ORDER:
1. Piece arc wedges into quarter-arcs (alternating Primary, Secondary, Contrast colors)
2. Join quarter-arcs into half-arcs, then full arcs
3. Attach arcs to Background center pieces using curved seam technique
4. Set in Accent melon shapes at the four corners where rings intersect

CURVED PIECING TECHNIQUE:
- Pin at center, edges, and several points along the curve
- Ease fabric gently - do NOT stretch bias edges
- Sew slowly, adjusting fabric as you go
- Press seams toward the darker fabric, following the curve
- Use a stiletto or pin to guide fabric under the presser foot

ACCURACY TIPS:
- Consider foundation paper piecing or freezer paper templates
- Match arc centers and ends precisely before sewing
- Check that melons fit properly in corner openings before sewing
- Starch fabrics lightly to stabilize bias edges

For scrappy arcs: randomize fabric placement within each arc segment while maintaining 
the overall Primary/Secondary alternation for the interlocking effect.`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Double Wedding Ring mistakes:
- Stretching bias edges on curves (causes puckering, rippling, and distortion)
- Using inaccurate templates (rings won't align when blocks are joined)
- Rushing curved seams without adequate pinning (leads to misalignment)
- Pressing curves flat instead of maintaining the curved shape
- Not testing templates on scrap fabric first (waste of good fabric)
- Insufficient seam allowance on curves (makes piecing nearly impossible)
- Trying this pattern as a first project (start with simpler curves like Drunkard's Path)
- In scrappy versions: not distributing colors evenly (creates unwanted color clusters)
- Mixing up which melon pieces go in which corners (breaks the ring continuity)
- Not easing fabric gradually (creates tucks and pleats in the seam)`
