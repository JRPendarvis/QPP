  patternName: 'Double Wedding Ring',
  recommendedFabricCount: 3,
  
  characteristics: `Double Wedding Ring is an iconic curved pattern creating interlocking rings:
- Curved arc bands form continuous interlocking ring chains
- Horizontal rings (COLOR1) and vertical rings (COLOR3) weave through each other
- Melon shapes form at the corners where rings intersect (complete when tiled)
- Background (COLOR2) shows through the ring centers
- One of the most recognizable traditional patterns
- Creates an allover design — rings connect seamlessly across blocks`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Double Wedding Ring specifically:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Horizontal arc bands and corner melons — one ring direction
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Ring centers and negative space — often white or cream
- COLOR3 (ACCENT): Vertical arc bands — the second ring direction
- High contrast between rings and background makes the interlocking pattern pop
- Traditional versions often use scrappy arcs with many fabrics per ring`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Double Wedding Ring cutting specifics:
- Requires curved templates (purchased or custom drafted)
- Cut arc segments for each ring band (typically 4 wedges per quarter-arc)
- Cut melon/football shapes for the intersections
- Cut background pieces for ring centers
- Specialized rulers (e.g., Marti Michell, Accuquilt dies) highly recommended`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Double Wedding Ring:
- Advanced pattern requiring curved piecing skills
- Piece arc wedges into quarter-arcs, then half-arcs
- Join arcs to background centers
- Set in melon shapes at ring intersections
- Pin and ease curves carefully — don't stretch
- Foundation paper piecing or freezer paper templates improve accuracy`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Double Wedding Ring mistakes:
- Stretching bias edges on curves (causes puckering and distortion)
- Inaccurate templates (rings won't align when joined)
- Rushing curved seams (take time to pin frequently)
- Pressing curves flat instead of following the curve direction
- Not testing templates on scrap fabric first`
