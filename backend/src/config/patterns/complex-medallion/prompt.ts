  patternName: 'Complex Medallion',
  recommendedFabricCount: 3,
  
  characteristics: `A Complex Medallion is a decorative center-focused design with layered borders:
- Nested rectangular borders framing the block
- A four-pointed star in the center made of kite-shaped pieces
- A center square at the star's core
- Decorative corner elements (circles in the visualization)
- Small accent triangles near the inner corners
- Designed as a focal point rather than a simple repeating block`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Complex Medallion specifically:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): The star points and inner frame — the main visual focus
- COLOR2 (ACCENT): Corner decorations and small triangles — adds detail and interest
- COLOR3 (SECONDARY): Outer border and center square — frames the design`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Complex Medallion cutting specifics:
- Cut border strips for the nested frames
- Cut four kite shapes for the star points (use templates)
- Cut one center square
- Corner circles require appliqué technique
- Small triangles can be foundation paper-pieced for accuracy`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Complex Medallion:
- Build from the center outward
- Piece the star first, then add the center square
- Attach borders in sequence from inner to outer
- Appliqué corner circles last
- Press seams toward borders`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Complex Medallion mistakes:
- Forgetting to add background fabric behind the star
- Misalignment the star points (should be centered and symmetric)
- Uneven border widths
- Puckering when appliquéing corner circles`
