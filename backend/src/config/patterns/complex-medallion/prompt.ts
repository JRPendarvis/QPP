  characteristics: `A Complex Medallion is a decorative center-focused design with layered borders:
- Nested rectangular borders framing the block
- A four-pointed star in the center made of kite-shaped pieces
- A center square at the star's core
- Decorative corner elements (circles in the visualization)
- Small accent triangles near the inner corners
- Designed as a focal point rather than a simple repeating block
- Typically used as a quilt center or as a single statement block`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `Complex Medallion fabric assignments (supports 2-8 fabrics):

WITH 2 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Star points, inner frame, and corner decorations
- COLOR2 (SECONDARY): Outer border, center square, and background areas

WITH 3 FABRICS (recommended):
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): The star points and inner frame — the main visual focus
- COLOR2 (ACCENT): Corner decorations and small triangles — adds detail and interest
- COLOR3 (SECONDARY): Outer border and center square — frames the design

WITH 4+ FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Star points — dominant visual element
- COLOR2 (SECONDARY): Inner frame and border accents
- COLOR3 (ACCENT): Corner decorations and small triangles
- COLOR4 (BACKGROUND): Outer border and center square
- Additional fabrics can add depth to borders or star point gradients

Note: As a medallion design, fabric placement is fixed — this pattern does not use scrappy block-to-block rotation.`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Complex Medallion cutting specifics:
- Cut border strips for the nested frames
- Cut four kite shapes for the star points (use templates)
- Cut one center square
- Corner circles require appliqué technique
- Small triangles can be foundation paper-pieced for accuracy`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Complex Medallion:
- Build from the center outward
- Piece the star first, then add the center square
- Attach borders in sequence from inner to outer
- Appliqué corner circles last
- Press seams toward borders`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Complex Medallion mistakes:
- Forgetting to add background fabric behind the star
- Misaligning the star points (should be centered and symmetric)
- Uneven border widths
- Puckering when appliquéing corner circles`
