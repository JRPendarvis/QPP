  patternName: "Mariner's Compass",
  recommendedFabricCount: 6,
  
  characteristics: `Mariner's Compass is a dramatic radiating pattern with layered points of varying lengths:
- 16 points total radiating from a center octagon
- 4 long cardinal points (N, E, S, W) — most prominent
- 4 medium ordinal points (NE, SE, SW, NW) — mid-length
- 8 short intermediate points between the others
- All pieced from triangular wedges — no appliqué circles
- Center octagon anchors the design
- Different point lengths create dramatic depth and visual interest
- One of the most challenging and impressive traditional patterns`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Mariner's Compass specifically:
- COLOR1: Long cardinal points and/or center — highest visual impact
- COLOR2: Medium ordinal points — secondary prominence
- COLOR3-6: Short intermediate points — can alternate for added interest
- Highest COLOR number: Background
- With more fabrics, points alternate colors within each type
- High contrast between points and background makes the compass pop
- Consider value gradation: light points on dark background (or vice versa)`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Mariner's Compass cutting specifics:
- All points are elongated triangles (kite-shaped with pointed ends)
- Use templates or foundation paper piecing for accuracy
- Cut center octagon using template
- Cut background square with center area open for compass
- CRITICAL: Precise angles — even small errors multiply across 16 points
- Foundation paper piecing strongly recommended`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Mariner's Compass:
- Foundation paper piece for best accuracy
- Build in sections: quarter compass units, then halves, then whole
- Set center octagon into the points (Y-seams required)
- Set compass into background (more Y-seams)
- Press carefully — many seams converge at center
- This is an advanced pattern — patience and precision are essential`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Mariner's Compass mistakes:
- Inaccurate point angles (compass won't lie flat)
- Stretching bias edges on triangles
- Inconsistent seam allowances (points won't meet at center)
- Not using foundation paper piecing (accuracy suffers dramatically)
- Rushing Y-seams when setting in center and background
- Low contrast between points and background (pattern loses drama)`
