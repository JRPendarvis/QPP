  patternName: "Mariner's Compass",
  recommendedFabricCount: 4,
  
  characteristics: `Mariner's Compass is a dramatic radiating pattern with layered points of varying lengths:
- 16 points total radiating from a center octagon
- 4 long cardinal points (N, E, S, W) — most prominent
- 4 medium ordinal points (NE, SE, SW, NW) — mid-length
- 8 short intermediate points between the others
- All pieced from triangular wedges — no appliqué circles
- Center octagon anchors the design
- Different point lengths create dramatic depth and visual interest
- One of the most challenging and impressive traditional patterns
- Typically a single statement block, not a repeating unit`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `Mariner's Compass fabric assignments (supports 2-8 fabrics):

WITH 2 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): All 16 points (cardinal, ordinal, and intermediate)
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Background square and center octagon

WITH 3 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Long cardinal points — highest visual impact
- COLOR2 (SECONDARY): Medium ordinal points and short intermediate points
- COLOR3 (BACKGROUND): Background square and center octagon

WITH 4 FABRICS (recommended):
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Background square
- COLOR2 (PRIMARY): Long cardinal points — most prominent
- COLOR3 (SECONDARY): Medium ordinal points
- COLOR4 (ACCENT): Short intermediate points and center octagon

WITH 5-6 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Background square
- COLOR2 (ACCENT): Center octagon — focal anchor
- COLOR3 (PRIMARY): Long cardinal points
- COLOR4 (SECONDARY): Medium ordinal points
- COLOR5-6 (TERTIARY): Short intermediate points, alternating colors

WITH 7-8 FABRICS (maximum variety):
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Background square
- COLOR2 (ACCENT): Center octagon
- COLOR3-4 (PRIMARY): Long cardinal points, alternating
- COLOR5-6 (SECONDARY): Medium ordinal points, alternating
- COLOR7-8 (TERTIARY): Short intermediate points, alternating

High contrast between points and background makes the compass pop. Consider value gradation: light points on dark background (or vice versa).

Note: Mariner's Compass is a radial design — fabric placement is fixed, not rotated block-to-block.`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Mariner's Compass cutting specifics:
- All points are elongated triangles (kite-shaped with pointed ends)
- Use templates or foundation paper piecing for accuracy
- Cut center octagon using template
- Cut background square with center area open for compass
- CRITICAL: Precise angles — even small errors multiply across 16 points
- Foundation paper piecing strongly recommended`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Mariner's Compass:
- Foundation paper piece for best accuracy
- Build in sections: quarter compass units, then halves, then whole
- Set center octagon into the points (Y-seams required)
- Set compass into background (more Y-seams)
- Press carefully — many seams converge at center
- This is an advanced pattern — patience and precision are essential`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Mariner's Compass mistakes:
- Inaccurate point angles (compass won't lie flat)
- Stretching bias edges on triangles
- Inconsistent seam allowances (points won't meet at center)
- Not using foundation paper piecing (accuracy suffers dramatically)
- Rushing Y-seams when setting in center and background
- Low contrast between points and background (pattern loses drama)
- Adjacent point types with too-similar colors (layered effect disappears)`
