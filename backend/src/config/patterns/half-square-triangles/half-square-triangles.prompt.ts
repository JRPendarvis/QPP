  patternName: 'Half-Square Triangles',
  
  characteristics: `Half-Square Triangles (HST) is the fundamental diagonal-split unit in quilting:
- Each HST unit is a square divided diagonally into two triangles
- Each unit uses a pair of fabrics — one per triangle
- Multiple HST units tile together to showcase more fabrics (2-8 colors)
- Colors are always paired within each unit
- Foundation for countless patterns: pinwheels, chevrons, zigzags, stars, and more
- Rotation and arrangement of HSTs creates infinite design possibilities`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Half-Square Triangles specifically:
- Colors are used in pairs — each pair shares one HST unit
- 2 colors: Single HST with COLOR1/COLOR2
- 4 colors: Two pairs (COLOR1/COLOR2 and COLOR3/COLOR4)
- 6 colors: Three pairs
- 8 colors: Four unique pairs, one per quadrant
- Contrast within each pair defines the diagonal; contrast between pairs adds variety`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Half-Square Triangle cutting specifics:
- Traditional method: Cut squares, draw diagonal, sew both sides, cut apart (yields 2 HSTs)
- Cut starting squares 7/8" larger than finished HST size
- Alternative: Use triangle paper or specialty rulers
- Stitch-and-flip method works for smaller HSTs
- Trim all HSTs to exact size for precise piecing`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Half-Square Triangles:
- Press seams toward the darker triangle (or open for less bulk)
- Trim dog ears after pressing
- Square up each HST before assembling into larger units
- Plan orientation before sewing — rotation changes the pattern dramatically
- Nest seams when joining multiple HSTs`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Half-Square Triangle mistakes:
- Stretching bias edges (triangles distort)
- Inconsistent HST sizes (blocks won't align)
- Not trimming to exact size (small errors compound)
- Random orientation without planning (loses intended pattern)
- Pressing all seams the same direction when nesting is needed`
