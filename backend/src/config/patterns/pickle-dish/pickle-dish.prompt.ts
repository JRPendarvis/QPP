  patternName: 'Pickle Dish',
  
  characteristics: `Pickle Dish (also called Indian Wedding Ring) is an intricate curved pattern with pointed spikes:
- Four curved arc bands arranged in a ring formation
- Each arc has pointed triangular "pickle" spikes along its outer edge
- Corner melon shapes where adjacent arcs meet
- Center opening reveals the background
- Similar to Double Wedding Ring but with pointed spikes instead of smooth arcs
- When tiled, creates interlocking rings with dramatic sawtooth edges
- One of the most challenging traditional curved patterns`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Pickle Dish specifically:
- COLOR1: Primary arc bands — dominant visual element
- COLOR2-4: Spike triangles — can alternate for added interest
- Additional colors: Secondary arc bands and corner melons
- Highest COLOR number: Background (shows through center and around rings)
- High contrast between spikes and arc bands creates the pickle/sawtooth effect
- Traditional versions often use scrappy spikes with many fabrics`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Pickle Dish cutting specifics:
- FOUNDATION PAPER PIECING REQUIRED for spike sections — essential for accuracy
- Use curved templates for arc bands
- Cut melon shapes for corners using templates
- Cut background with ring opening
- All curved pieces require precise templates
- This is an advanced pattern — templates or paper piecing is mandatory`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Pickle Dish:
- Paper piece each spiked arc section first
- Join arc sections to form the ring (curved seams)
- Set in corner melon shapes (Y-seams)
- Attach completed ring to background (curved seam)
- Pin frequently along all curves
- Press curves carefully — follow the arc direction
- Work slowly — accuracy is everything`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Pickle Dish mistakes:
- Attempting spikes without foundation paper piecing (they won't align)
- Stretching bias edges on curves (causes distortion)
- Inconsistent spike angles (breaks the sawtooth rhythm)
- Not clipping concave seam allowances (causes puckers)
- Rushing curved seams (this pattern requires patience)
- Low contrast between spikes and arc background (pickle effect is lost)`
