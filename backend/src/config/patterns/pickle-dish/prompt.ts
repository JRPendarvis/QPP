  characteristics: `Pickle Dish (also called Indian Wedding Ring) is an intricate curved pattern with pointed spikes:
- Four curved arc bands arranged in a ring formation
- Each arc has pointed triangular "pickle" spikes along its outer edge
- Corner melon shapes where adjacent arcs meet
- Center opening reveals the background
- Similar to Double Wedding Ring but with pointed spikes instead of smooth arcs
- When tiled, creates interlocking rings with dramatic sawtooth edges
- One of the most challenging traditional curved patterns
- Traditional versions often use scrappy spikes with many fabrics`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `Pickle Dish fabric assignments (supports 2-8 fabrics):

WITH 2 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Arc bands, spikes, and corner melons
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Center opening and surrounding background

WITH 3 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Arc bands — dominant curved element
- COLOR2 (SECONDARY): Spikes and corner melons
- COLOR3 (BACKGROUND): Center opening and surrounding background

WITH 4 FABRICS (recommended):
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Center opening and surrounding background
- COLOR2 (PRIMARY): Arc bands — dominant curved element
- COLOR3 (SECONDARY): Spike triangles — sawtooth accent
- COLOR4 (ACCENT): Corner melon shapes

WITH 5-6 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Center opening and surrounding background
- COLOR2 (PRIMARY): Arc bands
- COLOR3-5 (SECONDARY): Spikes alternate colors for added interest
- COLOR6 (ACCENT): Corner melon shapes

WITH 7-8 FABRICS (scrappy spikes):
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Consistent background throughout
- COLOR2 (PRIMARY): Arc bands — consistent across rings
- COLOR3-7 (SECONDARY): Spike triangles cycle through multiple colors
- COLOR8 (ACCENT): Corner melon shapes

High contrast between spikes and arc bands creates the dramatic sawtooth/pickle effect.

Note: Spike direction is fixed — intentional block orientation at layout creates the interlocking ring effect.`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Pickle Dish cutting specifics:
- FOUNDATION PAPER PIECING REQUIRED for spike sections — essential for accuracy
- Use curved templates for arc bands
- Cut melon shapes for corners using templates
- Cut background with ring opening
- All curved pieces require precise templates
- This is an advanced pattern — templates or paper piecing is mandatory
- For scrappy spikes: cut spike triangles from multiple fabrics`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Pickle Dish:
- Paper piece each spiked arc section first
- Join arc sections to form the ring (curved seams)
- Set in corner melon shapes (Y-seams)
- Attach completed ring to background (curved seam)
- Pin frequently along all curves
- Press curves carefully — follow the arc direction
- Work slowly — accuracy is everything
- For scrappy spikes: plan spike color sequence before paper piecing`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Pickle Dish mistakes:
- Attempting spikes without foundation paper piecing (they won't align)
- Stretching bias edges on curves (causes distortion)
- Inconsistent spike angles (breaks the sawtooth rhythm)
- Not clipping concave seam allowances (causes puckers)
- Rushing curved seams (this pattern requires patience)
- Low contrast between spikes and arc background (pickle effect is lost)
- In scrappy versions: clustering same-color spikes instead of distributing evenly`
