  characteristics: `Feathered Star is an advanced traditional pattern combining a central star with sawtooth "feather" edges:
- Four corner background squares
- An 8-pointed star core formed by flying geese and half-square triangles
- A center square as the focal point
- Rows of small alternating triangles ("feathers") along the outer edges of the star
- Feathers point outward, creating a sawtooth silhouette around the star
- One of the most challenging and impressive traditional blocks
- Traditional versions often feature scrappy feathers for added visual interest`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `Feathered Star fabric assignments (supports 2-8 fabrics):

WITH 2 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Star points, center square, and all feather triangles
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Corner squares, negative space, and alternating feather triangles

WITH 3 FABRICS (recommended):
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Main star points and majority of feather triangles — dominates the design
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Corner squares and negative space — frames the star
- COLOR3 (ACCENT): Center square and alternating feather triangles — adds sparkle and depth

WITH 4+ FABRICS (scrappy feathers):
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Consistent corner squares and negative space
- COLOR2 (PRIMARY): Main star points — the dominant element
- COLOR3 (ACCENT): Center square — focal point
- COLOR4-8 (FEATHER options): Feather triangles rotate colors for scrappy variety

High contrast between star (PRIMARY) and background makes the star pop. Feather colors should contrast with each other so the sawtooth effect remains visible.`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Feathered Star cutting specifics:
- Cut four corner squares (BACKGROUND)
- Cut one center square (ACCENT)
- Cut triangles for the main star points (flying geese units)
- Cut half-square triangles for diagonal star sections
- Cut many small triangles for feathers — accuracy is critical
- Foundation paper piecing strongly recommended for feather sections
- For scrappy feathers: cut small triangles from multiple fabrics`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Feathered Star:
- Build feather strips first (alternating small triangles)
- Construct the central star unit separately
- Attach feather strips to the star's outer edges
- Add corner squares last
- Press carefully — many seams converge at center
- Consider partial seams or Y-seams depending on construction method
- For scrappy feathers: plan triangle color placement before piecing strips`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Feathered Star mistakes:
- Inaccurate small triangles (feathers won't align — use paper piecing)
- Inconsistent seam allowances (compounds across many small pieces)
- Not enough contrast between feather colors (sawtooth effect disappears)
- Rushing the feather strips (this is the hardest part — take your time)
- Forgetting to square up units before joining (small errors multiply)
- In scrappy versions: clustering same-color feathers instead of distributing evenly`
