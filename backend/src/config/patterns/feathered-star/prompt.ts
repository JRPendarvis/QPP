  patternName: 'Feathered Star',
  recommendedFabricCount: 3,
  
  characteristics: `Feathered Star is an advanced traditional pattern combining a central star with sawtooth "feather" edges:
- Four corner background squares
- An 8-pointed star core formed by flying geese and half-square triangles
- A center square as the focal point
- Rows of small alternating triangles ("feathers") along the outer edges of the star
- Feathers point outward, creating a sawtooth silhouette around the star
- One of the most challenging and impressive traditional blocks`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Feathered Star specifically:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Main star points and majority of feather triangles — dominates the design
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Corner squares and negative space — frames the star
- COLOR3 (ACCENT): Center square and alternating feather triangles — adds sparkle and depth
- High contrast between star (COLOR1) and background (COLOR2) makes the star pop
- COLOR3 should contrast with COLOR1 so feathers create visible sawtooth effect`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Feathered Star cutting specifics:
- Cut four corner squares (COLOR2)
- Cut one center square (COLOR3)
- Cut triangles for the main star points (flying geese units)
- Cut half-square triangles for diagonal star sections
- Cut many small triangles for feathers — accuracy is critical
- Foundation paper piecing strongly recommended for feather sections`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Feathered Star:
- Build feather strips first (alternating small triangles)
- Construct the central star unit separately
- Attach feather strips to the star's outer edges
- Add corner squares last
- Press carefully — many seams converge at center
- Consider partial seams or Y-seams depending on construction method`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Feathered Star mistakes:
- Inaccurate small triangles (feathers won't align — use paper piecing)
- Inconsistent seam allowances (compounds across many small pieces)
- Not enough contrast between feather colors (sawtooth effect disappears)
- Rushing the feather strips (this is the hardest part — take your time)
- Forgetting to square up units before joining (small errors multiply)`
