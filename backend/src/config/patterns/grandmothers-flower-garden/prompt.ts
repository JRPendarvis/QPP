  characteristics: `Grandmother's Flower Garden is a classic hexagon-based pattern forming flower clusters:
- One center hexagon surrounded by six petal hexagons sharing edges
- All hexagons are identical in size and shape
- Creates a "flower" with center as the focal point and ring as petals
- When tiled, flowers connect via "garden path" hexagons between blooms
- One of the most beloved vintage quilt patterns
- Traditionally made with English Paper Piecing (EPP)
- Often features scrappy petals with many different fabrics`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `Grandmother's Flower Garden fabric assignments (supports 2-8 fabrics):

WITH 2 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Center hexagon and alternating petals
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Remaining petals (doubles as garden path when tiled)

WITH 3 FABRICS (traditional):
- COLOR1 (ACCENT): Center hexagon — the flower's focal point
- COLOR2 (PRIMARY): All six petal hexagons — the flower ring
- COLOR3 (BACKGROUND): Garden path hexagons between flowers when tiled

WITH 4-6 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (ACCENT): Center hexagon — consistent across all flowers
- COLOR2-5 (PETAL options): Petals cycle through available colors around the ring
- Highest COLOR (BACKGROUND): Garden path hexagons

WITH 7-8 FABRICS (fully scrappy):
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Garden path — consistent throughout
- COLOR2 (ACCENT): Center hexagons — consistent focal point
- COLOR3-8 (PETAL options): Each petal can be unique; colors rotate across flowers

Traditional Grandmother's Flower Garden quilts often use dozens of fabrics in the petals. With 4-8 fabrics, petal colors rotate for scrappy charm while maintaining consistent centers and paths.`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Grandmother's Flower Garden cutting specifics:
- Cut all hexagons the same size using a template or die cutter
- English Paper Piecing (EPP) is the traditional method — baste fabric over paper hexagons
- Acrylic templates or Accuquilt dies ensure consistent sizing
- Cut slightly larger than finished size to allow for seam allowances
- One flower unit requires 7 hexagons (1 center + 6 petals)
- For scrappy petals: cut petal hexagons from multiple fabrics`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Grandmother's Flower Garden:
- English Paper Piecing: baste fabric over paper templates, whipstitch edges together
- Machine piecing is possible with Y-seams but more challenging
- Build each flower unit, then join flowers with path hexagons
- Remove papers after surrounding hexagons are attached (or leave until quilting)
- Press gently to avoid distorting hexagon shapes
- For scrappy layouts: lay out all flowers before stitching to balance colors`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Grandmother's Flower Garden mistakes:
- Inconsistent hexagon sizes (flowers won't nest together properly)
- Stretching bias edges (hexagons distort)
- Pulling whipstitches too tight (puckers the fabric)
- Not aligning edges precisely (gaps appear between hexagons)
- Removing paper templates too early (shapes lose stability)
- In scrappy versions: clustering similar colors instead of distributing across flowers`
