  characteristics: `Grandmother's Flower Garden is a classic hexagon-based pattern forming flower clusters:
- One center hexagon surrounded by six petal hexagons sharing edges
- All hexagons are identical in size and shape
- Creates a "flower" with center as the focal point and ring as petals
- When tiled, flowers connect via "garden path" background between blooms
- One of the most beloved vintage quilt patterns
- Traditionally made with English Paper Piecing (EPP)
- Petal hexagons alternate in a pinwheel arrangement for visual interest`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `Grandmother's Flower Garden fabric assignments (supports 3-5 fabrics):

WITH 3 FABRICS (traditional):
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Garden path — fills space between flowers
- COLOR2 (ACCENT): Center hexagon — the flower's focal point
- COLOR3 (PRIMARY): All six petal hexagons — the flower ring

WITH 4 FABRICS (recommended):
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Garden path between flowers
- COLOR2 (ACCENT): Center hexagon — consistent focal point
- COLOR3 (PRIMARY): Inner petals — positions 1, 3, 5 (alternating)
- COLOR4 (SECONDARY): Outer petals — positions 2, 4, 6 (alternating)
This creates a pinwheel effect within each flower.

WITH 5 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Garden path between flowers
- COLOR2 (ACCENT): Center hexagon on most flowers
- COLOR3 (PRIMARY): Inner petals — positions 1, 3, 5
- COLOR4 (SECONDARY): Outer petals — positions 2, 4, 6
- COLOR5 (ACCENT 2): Alternate center hexagon for variety across rows

For best results, choose a calm background fabric, a bold center accent, and coordinating petal fabrics with good contrast between inner and outer positions.`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Grandmother's Flower Garden cutting specifics:
- Cut all hexagons the same size using a template or die cutter
- English Paper Piecing (EPP) is the traditional method — baste fabric over paper hexagons
- Acrylic templates or Accuquilt dies ensure consistent sizing
- Cut slightly larger than finished size to allow for seam allowances
- One flower unit requires 7 hexagons (1 center + 6 petals)
- With 4 fabrics: cut 3 inner petals and 3 outer petals per flower`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Grandmother's Flower Garden:
- English Paper Piecing: baste fabric over paper templates, whipstitch edges together
- Machine piecing is possible with Y-seams but more challenging
- Start with center hexagon, attach petals in alternating color sequence
- Build each flower unit, then join flowers via background/path areas
- Remove papers after surrounding hexagons are attached (or leave until quilting)
- Press gently to avoid distorting hexagon shapes
- Lay out all flowers before stitching to verify color placement`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Grandmother's Flower Garden mistakes:
- Inconsistent hexagon sizes (flowers won't nest together properly)
- Stretching bias edges (hexagons distort)
- Pulling whipstitches too tight (puckers the fabric)
- Not aligning edges precisely (gaps appear between hexagons)
- Removing paper templates too early (shapes lose stability)
- Mixing up inner/outer petal positions (breaks the alternating pinwheel effect)
- Choosing petals with insufficient contrast (pattern loses definition)`
