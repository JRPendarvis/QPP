  patternName: "Grandmother's Flower Garden",
  
  characteristics: `Grandmother's Flower Garden is a classic hexagon-based pattern forming flower clusters:
- One center hexagon surrounded by six hexagons sharing edges
- All hexagons are identical in size and shape
- Creates a "flower" with center as the focal point and ring as petals
- When tiled, flowers connect to create an allover honeycomb effect
- Number of fabrics determines color variety in the petal ring (2-8 colors)
- One of the most beloved vintage quilt patterns`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Grandmother's Flower Garden specifically:
- COLOR1: Center hexagon — the flower's focal point
- COLOR2 through COLOR7: Surrounding petal hexagons — distributed around the ring
- With fewer colors, petals alternate or cycle through available fabrics
- With 7 colors, each petal is unique
- With 8 colors, partial outer ring accents are added
- Traditional versions often use scrappy petals with many fabrics`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Grandmother's Flower Garden cutting specifics:
- Cut all hexagons the same size using a template or die cutter
- English Paper Piecing (EPP) is the traditional method — baste fabric over paper hexagons
- Acrylic templates or Accuquilt dies ensure consistent sizing
- Cut slightly larger than finished size to allow for seam allowances
- One flower unit requires 7 hexagons (1 center + 6 surrounding)`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Grandmother's Flower Garden:
- English Paper Piecing: baste fabric over paper templates, whipstitch edges together
- Machine piecing is possible with Y-seams but more challenging
- Build each flower unit, then join flowers together
- Remove papers after surrounding hexagons are attached (or leave until quilting)
- Press gently to avoid distorting hexagon shapes`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Grandmother's Flower Garden mistakes:
- Inconsistent hexagon sizes (flowers won't nest together properly)
- Stretching bias edges (hexagons distort)
- Pulling whipstitches too tight (puckers the fabric)
- Not aligning edges precisely (gaps appear between hexagons)
- Removing paper templates too early (shapes lose stability)`
