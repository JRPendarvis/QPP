  patternName: 'Sawtooth Star',
  recommendedFabricCount: 2,
  
  characteristics: `Sawtooth Star is a classic star block with pointed "teeth":
- Four corner squares (background)
- Four flying geese units forming the star points
- Each flying geese has one large triangle (the point) and two small triangles (sky)
- All four star points aim toward the center
- One center square as the star's focal point
- Creates a bold, graphic star when assembled
- Foundation for many star variations`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `Sawtooth Star fabric assignments (supports 2-8 fabrics):

WITH 2 FABRICS (traditional):
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Star points and center square — the dominant visual element
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Corner squares and sky triangles in flying geese

WITH 3 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Star point triangles — the bold star shape
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Corner squares and sky triangles
- COLOR3 (ACCENT): Center square — distinguishes focal point from points

WITH 4 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Corner squares and sky triangles
- COLOR2 (PRIMARY): One diagonal pair of star points
- COLOR3 (SECONDARY): Other diagonal pair of star points
- COLOR4 (ACCENT): Center square

WITH 5-6 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Corner squares and sky triangles — consistent framing
- COLOR2-5 (PRIMARY): Each star point a unique fabric
- COLOR6 (ACCENT): Center square

WITH 7-8 FABRICS (scrappy):
- COLOR1-4 (BACKGROUND options): Corner squares and sky triangles rotate colors
- COLOR5-7 (PRIMARY): Star points rotate through colors
- COLOR8 (ACCENT): Center square — consistent focal point

High contrast between star points and background makes the star pop. The center square can match the points or provide a distinct accent.`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Sawtooth Star cutting specifics:
- Cut four squares for corners (BACKGROUND fabric)
- Cut one center square (PRIMARY or ACCENT fabric)
- Flying geese: cut four large triangles for points, eight small triangles for sky
- Or use the stitch-and-flip method for flying geese units
- Corner squares are 1/4 the block width; center is 1/2 the block width
- For scrappy versions: cut star point triangles from multiple fabrics`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Sawtooth Star:
- Build all four flying geese units first
- Arrange in a 3x3 grid: corners, geese, center
- Sew into three rows, then join rows
- Press seams toward the darker fabric
- Ensure all star points aim toward center before sewing
- For scrappy layouts: plan which star point fabrics go where before assembling`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Sawtooth Star mistakes:
- Flying geese pointing the wrong direction (star points must aim inward)
- Cutting off star points with seam allowances (use scant 1/4" seams)
- Low contrast between star and background (star disappears)
- Misaligned flying geese (points won't meet center cleanly)
- In scrappy versions: placing similar-colored star points adjacent to each other`
