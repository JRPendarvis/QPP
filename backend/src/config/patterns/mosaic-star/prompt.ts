  characteristics: `Mosaic Star is an advanced traditional pattern combining a central star with sawtooth "feather" edges:
- Four corner background squares frame the design
- An 8-pointed star core radiates from the center
- Rows of small alternating triangles ("feathers") create a sawtooth edge around the star points
- A center square serves as the focal point
- Feathers point outward, creating delicate serrated edges
- One of the most challenging and impressive traditional quilt blocks
- Requires precision piecing - many small triangles must align perfectly
- Expert-level pattern showcasing advanced piecing skills`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `Mosaic Star fabric assignments (supports 3-5 fabrics):

WITH 3 FABRICS (minimum):
- BACKGROUND (fabricColors[0]): Corner squares, setting triangles, negative space
- PRIMARY (fabricColors[1]): Main 8-pointed star (the dominant visual element)
- SECONDARY (fabricColors[2]): Feathers (tiny triangles) AND center square

The star pops against the background, with feathers creating the signature serrated edge.

WITH 4 FABRICS (recommended):
- BACKGROUND (fabricColors[0]): Corner squares, setting triangles, negative space
- PRIMARY (fabricColors[1]): Main 8-pointed star points
- SECONDARY (fabricColors[2]): Feathers (tiny alternating triangles around star)
- ACCENT (fabricColors[3]): Center square (creates a focal point)

This is the classic Feathered Star palette with maximum clarity and impact.

WITH 5 FABRICS (maximum complexity):
- BACKGROUND (fabricColors[0]): Corner squares, setting triangles, negative space
- PRIMARY (fabricColors[1]): Main 8-pointed star points
- SECONDARY (fabricColors[2]): Primary feather color (half of the tiny triangles)
- ACCENT (fabricColors[3]): Center square
- CONTRAST (fabricColors[4]): Alternating feather color (other half of tiny triangles)

Using two feather colors (Secondary and Contrast alternating) creates the most intricate 
sawtooth effect and adds depth to the feathered edges.

DESIGN TIP: High contrast between Primary star and Background is essential. 
Feathers should also contrast with each other so the sawtooth effect remains crisp and visible.`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Feathered Star cutting specifics:

BACKGROUND fabric (fabricColors[0]):
- Cut 4 corner squares (typically 1/4 of block width each)
- Cut setting triangles for around the star
- Cut background triangles that alternate with feather triangles

PRIMARY fabric (fabricColors[1]):
- Cut diamonds or triangles for the 8 main star points
- May require templates for precise angles

SECONDARY fabric (fabricColors[2]):
- Cut many small triangles for feathers (typically 1/2" to 1" finished)
- For 3-fabric version: also cut center square

ACCENT fabric (fabricColors[3]) - if using 4-5 fabrics:
- Cut 1 center square

CONTRAST fabric (fabricColors[4]) - if using 5 fabrics:
- Cut additional small triangles for alternating feathers

CRITICAL: Accuracy is essential for the tiny feather triangles.
Foundation paper piecing is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED for the feather sections.
Each feather strip typically contains 8-16 tiny triangles that must align perfectly.`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Feathered Star:
- This is an EXPERT-LEVEL pattern requiring advanced piecing skills

CONSTRUCTION ORDER:
1. Build feather strips first (alternating tiny triangles)
   - Use foundation paper piecing for accuracy
   - Each strip typically has 8-16 small triangles
   - Press seams consistently toward darker fabric
2. Construct the central 8-pointed star unit separately
   - Use flying geese units or set-in seams
   - Ensure star points are sharp and symmetrical
3. Attach feather strips to the outer edges of each star point
   - Pin carefully at seam intersections
   - Strips must align with star point edges
4. Add ACCENT center square to the middle
5. Add BACKGROUND corner squares at the four corners last
   - Corners complete the square block shape

PRECISION TIPS:
- Square up each unit before joining (small errors multiply)
- Many seams converge at the center - press carefully to reduce bulk
- Use a scant 1/4" seam allowance throughout
- Consider using partial seams or Y-seams depending on construction method
- Starch fabrics lightly to stabilize all the small pieces
- Take breaks - this block requires sustained focus and accuracy

For 5-fabric version: alternate SECONDARY and CONTRAST colors in the feather strips 
(Secondary, Contrast, Secondary, Contrast...) for maximum sawtooth effect.`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Feathered Star mistakes:
- Attempting without foundation paper piecing (feathers won't align - accuracy is impossible by traditional piecing)
- Inconsistent seam allowances (small errors multiply across dozens of tiny triangles)
- Insufficient contrast between feather colors (sawtooth effect disappears)
- Rushing the feather strips (this is the most challenging part - take your time)
- Not squaring up units before assembly (compounds alignment problems)
- Pressing feather seams all in one direction (creates bulk and distortion)
- Attempting this as an early project (master simpler stars first: Ohio Star, Sawtooth Star)
- Using directional prints for tiny feather triangles (pattern gets lost)
- Not testing the pattern with scrap fabric first (too expensive to waste good fabric)
- Skipping the center square accent (makes the design feel incomplete)`
