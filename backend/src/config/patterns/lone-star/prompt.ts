  patternName: 'Lone Star',
  recommendedFabricCount: 5,
  
  characteristics: `Lone Star (also called Star of Bethlehem) is a dramatic radiating 8-pointed star:
- Built from concentric rings of diamonds radiating from center
- Each ring is a different fabric, creating a sunburst effect
- 8 large diamond points extend from center to edges
- Corner squares and setting triangles fill the background
- One of the most impressive and recognizable traditional patterns
- Also known as: Star of Bethlehem, Star of the East, Blazing Star
- Typically a single statement block, not a repeating unit`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `Lone Star fabric assignments (supports 2-8 fabrics):

WITH 2 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): All star diamond rings
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Corner squares and setting triangles

WITH 3 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (ACCENT): Center ring — the focal point
- COLOR2 (PRIMARY): Outer ring(s) of diamonds
- COLOR3 (BACKGROUND): Corner squares and setting triangles

WITH 4-5 FABRICS (recommended):
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Corner squares and setting triangles
- COLOR2 (ACCENT): Center ring — often bold or high contrast
- COLOR3-5 (PRIMARY): Radiating rings from center outward

WITH 6-8 FABRICS (maximum drama):
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Corner squares and setting triangles
- COLOR2 (ACCENT): Center ring — the focal point
- COLOR3-8 (PRIMARY): Each ring is a distinct fabric, radiating outward

Traditional approach: Graduate values from center outward (light to dark or dark to light). Consider color temperature: warm center radiating to cool edges (or vice versa).

High contrast between adjacent rings creates the dramatic sunburst effect.

Note: Lone Star is a single radial design — fabric placement is fixed, not rotated block-to-block.`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Lone Star cutting specifics:
- All star pieces are diamonds (45° parallelograms)
- Cut diamonds using templates or 45° ruler
- Each ring requires 8 diamonds of the same fabric
- Cut corner squares and side setting triangles from background
- CRITICAL: Maintain consistent grain line on all diamonds
- Strip piecing method speeds up cutting and improves accuracy`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Lone Star:
- Build each of the 8 star points separately by joining diamond rows
- Join points in pairs, then quarters, then halves
- Set in corner squares and side triangles (Y-seams required)
- Press seams in alternating directions by row for nesting
- Work on a design wall to ensure correct color ring placement
- This is an advanced pattern — accuracy is essential`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Lone Star mistakes:
- Stretching diamond bias edges (star will not lie flat)
- Inconsistent seam allowances (rings won't align across points)
- Incorrect color ring sequence (breaks the radiating effect)
- Not pressing consistently (center becomes bulky)
- Rushing Y-seams when setting in corners (causes puckers)
- Cutting diamonds off-grain (causes distortion)
- Choosing adjacent ring colors with too little contrast (rings blend together)`
