  characteristics: `Drunkard's Path is a classic curved two-piece unit that creates flowing designs:
- Each unit contains one quarter-circle "pie slice" and one background piece with concave curve
- Four units combine to form a block with curves in each corner
- When tiled, creates meandering curved paths across the quilt
- Block rotation creates many secondary patterns: Love Ring, Vine of Friendship, Falling Timbers, Wonder of the World
- One of the most versatile curved-piecing patterns
- Simple two-piece construction, but curves require care`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `Drunkard's Path fabric assignments (supports 2-8 fabrics):

WITH 2 FABRICS (traditional):
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): All quarter-circle arcs — forms the curved path
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): All background pieces — defines the negative space

WITH 3 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Quarter-circles on one diagonal pair
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Center and negative space throughout
- COLOR3 (ACCENT): Quarter-circles on opposite diagonal — creates two-tone path

WITH 4+ FABRICS (scrappy curves):
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Consistent background across all blocks
- COLOR2-8 (PRIMARY options): Arc colors rotate across blocks/positions for variety

High contrast between curves and background emphasizes the wandering path. Using similar values for multiple arc colors creates a unified meandering line.

Note: Block rotation at layout time dramatically changes the overall design — plan curve placement carefully.`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Drunkard's Path cutting specifics:
- Cut squares for the background pieces (with concave curve cut out)
- Cut quarter-circles using curved templates or specialty rulers
- Each unit is two pieces: one quarter-circle, one background with concave curve
- Acrylic templates or Accuquilt dies make cutting accurate curves easier
- Add seam allowance to both the convex and concave edges
- For scrappy quilts: cut quarter-circles from multiple fabrics`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Drunkard's Path:
- Pin at the center and ends of each curve, easing fullness between
- Sew with the concave (background) piece on top for better control
- Clip concave seam allowance if needed to reduce bulk
- Press seams toward the quarter-circle (convex piece)
- Lay out all units before sewing — rotation creates different patterns
- For scrappy layouts: plan arc color placement before assembling`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Drunkard's Path mistakes:
- Stretching the bias edges on curves (causes puckering)
- Not pinning enough along the curve (creates pleats)
- Pressing curves flat instead of following the seam direction
- Random unit rotation without planning (loses the path effect)
- Inconsistent seam allowances on curves (units won't match in size)
- In scrappy versions: not stepping back to check overall color flow`
