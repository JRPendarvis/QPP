  patternName: "Drunkard's Path",
  recommendedFabricCount: 3,
  
  characteristics: `Drunkard's Path is a classic curved two-piece unit that creates flowing designs:
- Four quarter-circle "pie slice" shapes, one in each corner
- Arcs are placed on opposite diagonals (COLOR1 on one diagonal, COLOR3 on the other)
- Background (COLOR2) shows through the center and between curves
- When tiled, creates meandering curved paths across the quilt
- Block rotation creates many secondary patterns: Love Ring, Vine of Friendship, Falling Timbers, Wonder of the World
- One of the most versatile curved-piecing patterns`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Drunkard's Path specifically:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Quarter-circles on one diagonal — part of the curved path
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Center and negative space — defines the path shape
- COLOR3 (ACCENT): Quarter-circles on opposite diagonal — contrasting curve direction
- High contrast between curves and background emphasizes the wandering path
- Using similar values for COLOR1 and COLOR3 creates a unified meandering line`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Drunkard's Path cutting specifics:
- Cut squares for the background pieces
- Cut quarter-circles using curved templates or specialty rulers
- Each unit is two pieces: one quarter-circle, one background with concave curve
- Acrylic templates or Accuquilt dies make cutting accurate curves easier
- Add seam allowance to both the convex and concave edges`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Drunkard's Path:
- Pin at the center and ends of each curve, easing fullness between
- Sew with the concave (background) piece on top for better control
- Clip concave seam allowance if needed to reduce bulk
- Press seams toward the quarter-circle (convex piece)
- Lay out all units before sewing — rotation creates different patterns`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Drunkard's Path mistakes:
- Stretching the bias edges on curves (causes puckering)
- Not pinning enough along the curve (creates pleats)
- Pressing curves flat instead of following the seam direction
- Random unit rotation without planning (loses the path effect)
- Inconsistent seam allowances on curves (units won't match in size)`
