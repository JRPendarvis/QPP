  patternName: 'New York Beauty',
  recommendedFabricCount: 4,
  
  characteristics: `New York Beauty is a dramatic curved pattern with radiating spikes:
- Quarter-circle design radiating from one corner
- Outer arc band contains paper-pieced spikes pointing outward
- Spikes radiate from the corner like a sunrise or crown
- Inner arc ring(s) add depth between spikes and corner piece
- Inner corner piece anchors the design (the "sun")
- Background fills the remaining area
- All curved piecing — an advanced pattern
- Creates stunning secondary patterns when blocks are intentionally rotated and tiled`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `New York Beauty fabric assignments (supports 2-8 fabrics):

WITH 2 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Spikes, inner corner piece, and inner arc ring(s)
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Arc band (spike background) and outer background

WITH 3 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Spikes — the dominant radiating element
- COLOR2 (ACCENT): Inner corner piece and inner arc ring(s)
- COLOR3 (BACKGROUND): Arc band and outer background

WITH 4 FABRICS (recommended):
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Outer background square
- COLOR2 (SECONDARY): Arc band — spike background
- COLOR3 (PRIMARY): All spikes — radiating points
- COLOR4 (ACCENT): Inner corner piece and inner arc ring(s)

WITH 5-6 FABRICS:
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Outer background square
- COLOR2 (SECONDARY): Arc band — spike background
- COLOR3-4 (PRIMARY): Spikes alternate colors for added interest
- COLOR5 (ACCENT): Inner arc ring(s)
- COLOR6 (ACCENT): Inner corner piece — focal anchor

WITH 7-8 FABRICS (maximum variety):
- COLOR1 (BACKGROUND): Outer background square
- COLOR2 (SECONDARY): Arc band
- COLOR3-6 (PRIMARY): Spikes cycle through multiple colors
- COLOR7 (ACCENT): Inner arc ring(s)
- COLOR8 (ACCENT): Inner corner piece

High contrast between spikes and arc band creates the dramatic radiating effect. Consider value gradation from corner outward (light to dark or dark to light).

Note: Spike direction is fixed — intentional block rotation at layout creates secondary patterns like pinwheels or continuous curves.`,

  cuttingInstructions: `New York Beauty cutting specifics:
- FOUNDATION PAPER PIECING REQUIRED for spikes — essential for accuracy
- Use curved templates for arc sections
- Cut background piece with quarter-circle removed
- Cut inner corner quarter-circle(s)
- All curved seams require templates or freezer paper guides
- This is an advanced pattern — precision cutting is critical
- For multi-color spikes: cut spike triangles from multiple fabrics`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for New York Beauty:
- Paper piece the spike arc section first
- Join inner arc ring(s) to spike section (curved seam)
- Add corner piece (curved seam)
- Set completed quarter-circle into background (curved seam)
- Pin frequently along curves, easing fullness
- Press curves carefully toward the simpler piece
- Consider spray starch to stabilize curves
- For multi-color spikes: plan spike color sequence before paper piecing`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these New York Beauty mistakes:
- Attempting spikes without foundation paper piecing (they won't be accurate)
- Stretching bias edges on curves
- Not clipping concave seam allowances (causes puckers)
- Inconsistent spike angles (breaks the radiating effect)
- Rushing curved seams (take time to pin and ease)
- Low contrast between spikes and arc band (pattern loses impact)
- Random block rotation instead of planned layout (loses secondary pattern potential)`
