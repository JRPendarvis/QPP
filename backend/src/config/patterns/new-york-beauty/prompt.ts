  patternName: 'New York Beauty',
  recommendedFabricCount: 5,
  
  characteristics: `New York Beauty is a dramatic curved pattern with radiating spikes:
- Quarter-circle design radiating from one corner
- Outer arc band contains paper-pieced spikes pointing outward
- Spikes radiate from the corner like a sunrise or crown
- Inner arc ring(s) add depth between spikes and corner piece
- Inner corner piece anchors the design (the "sun")
- Background fills the remaining area
- All curved piecing — an advanced pattern
- Creates stunning secondary patterns when blocks are rotated and tiled`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For New York Beauty specifically:
- COLOR1: Outer arc band (spike background) — prominent visual element
- COLOR2-5: Spike triangles — can alternate for added interest
- Inner arc rings: Additional accent colors
- Highest COLOR numbers: Inner corner piece and background
- High contrast between spikes and arc band creates dramatic effect
- Consider value gradation from corner outward (light to dark or dark to light)`,

  cuttingInstructions: `New York Beauty cutting specifics:
- FOUNDATION PAPER PIECING REQUIRED for spikes — essential for accuracy
- Use curved templates for arc sections
- Cut background piece with quarter-circle removed
- Cut inner corner quarter-circle(s)
- All curved seams require templates or freezer paper guides
- This is an advanced pattern — precision cutting is critical`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for New York Beauty:
- Paper piece the spike arc section first
- Join inner arc ring(s) to spike section (curved seam)
- Add corner piece (curved seam)
- Set completed quarter-circle into background (curved seam)
- Pin frequently along curves, easing fullness
- Press curves carefully toward the simpler piece
- Consider spray starch to stabilize curves`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these New York Beauty mistakes:
- Attempting spikes without foundation paper piecing (they won't be accurate)
- Stretching bias edges on curves
- Not clipping concave seam allowances (causes puckers)
- Inconsistent spike angles (breaks the radiating effect)
- Rushing curved seams (take time to pin and ease)
- Low contrast between spikes and background (pattern loses impact)`
