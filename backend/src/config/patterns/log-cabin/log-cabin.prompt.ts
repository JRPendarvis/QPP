  patternName: 'Log Cabin',
  
  characteristics: `Log Cabin is an iconic American pattern built from strips spiraling around a center:
- Center square (the "hearth") represents the fireplace in a cabin
- Strips ("logs") are added in rounds, spiraling outward
- Traditional light/dark division: two adjacent sides use light fabrics, two use dark fabrics
- Light side: top and right strips
- Dark side: bottom and left strips
- When blocks are tiled and rotated, secondary patterns emerge (Barn Raising, Straight Furrows, Courthouse Steps, etc.)
- Four rounds of strips create the classic proportions`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Log Cabin specifically:
- COLOR1: Center "hearth" square — traditionally red or yellow to symbolize fire/light
- Light side colors (COLOR2, COLOR3, COLOR4): Top and right strips — use lighter values
- Dark side colors (COLOR5, COLOR6, COLOR7, COLOR8): Bottom and left strips — use darker values
- More fabrics = more variety within each side, alternating by round
- Strong light/dark contrast creates the diagonal effect when blocks are tiled`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Log Cabin cutting specifics:
- Cut one center square
- Cut strips of consistent width (traditionally 1" to 1.5" finished)
- Strip lengths increase each round — can cut as you go or pre-cut
- Strip piecing from a strip set speeds up cutting
- Each round adds four strips (two light, two dark)`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Log Cabin:
- Start with center square
- Add strips clockwise (or counter-clockwise) in sequence: right, top, left, bottom
- Press seams away from center (toward the newest strip)
- Chain piece multiple blocks at once for efficiency
- Plan block rotation before assembling the quilt top to create desired secondary pattern`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Log Cabin mistakes:
- Mixing up light/dark sides (breaks the diagonal effect when tiled)
- Inconsistent strip widths (block becomes lopsided)
- Not pressing consistently (strips don't lie flat)
- Forgetting to plan block rotation (secondary pattern is random instead of intentional)
- Using center color that's too similar to surrounding strips (hearth disappears)`
