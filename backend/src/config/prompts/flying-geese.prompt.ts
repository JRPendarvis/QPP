  patternName: 'Flying Geese',
  
  characteristics: `Flying Geese is a classic directional pattern of stacked triangular units:
- Each "goose" is a large triangle pointing in one direction
- Two smaller "sky" triangles flank each goose
- Geese stack vertically, all pointing the same direction (upward)
- Number of geese adjusts based on fabrics provided (1-7 geese)
- Each goose can be a different fabric; sky uses one consistent fabric
- Creates strong directional movement when tiled`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Flying Geese specifically:
- COLOR1 through COLOR7: Individual goose triangles — each can showcase a different fabric
- Highest COLOR number: Sky triangles — consistent throughout, frames all geese
- Arrange goose fabrics light-to-dark for gradient effect, or alternate for contrast
- Sky fabric should contrast with geese so the points read clearly`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Flying Geese cutting specifics:
- Traditional flying geese ratio is 2:1 (width to height)
- For each goose: cut one large triangle (or use no-waste method with squares)
- For each sky pair: cut two small triangles (quarter-square size)
- No-waste method: 1 large square + 2 small squares yields 4 flying geese units
- Stitch-and-flip method also works well for accuracy`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Flying Geese:
- Build each goose unit separately (goose + two sky triangles)
- Stack and sew units together in desired order
- Press seams toward the goose (darker triangle) or open for less bulk
- Ensure all geese point the same direction before joining
- Trim dog ears to reduce bulk`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Flying Geese mistakes:
- Cutting off goose points with seam allowances (use scant 1/4" seams)
- Geese pointing different directions (check orientation before sewing)
- Inconsistent unit sizes (won't stack evenly)
- Low contrast between geese and sky (points disappear)
- Not trimming to exact size before joining units`
