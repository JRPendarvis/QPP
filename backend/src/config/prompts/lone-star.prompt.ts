  patternName: 'Lone Star',
  
  characteristics: `Lone Star (also called Star of Bethlehem) is a dramatic radiating 8-pointed star:
- Built from concentric rings of diamonds radiating from center
- Each ring is a different fabric, creating a sunburst effect
- 8 large diamond points extend from center to edges
- Corner squares and setting triangles fill the background
- The number of rings determines how many fabrics are showcased (3-8)
- One of the most impressive and recognizable traditional patterns
- Also known as: Star of Bethlehem, Star of the East, Blazing Star`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Lone Star specifically:
- COLOR1: Center of the star — the focal point, often a bold or contrasting color
- COLOR2 through COLOR6/7: Radiating rings — arranged from center outward
- Highest COLOR number: Background and corner squares
- Traditional approach: Graduate values from center (light or dark) outward
- High contrast between rings creates the dramatic sunburst effect
- Consider color temperature: warm center radiating to cool edges (or vice versa)`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Lone Star cutting specifics:
- All star pieces are diamonds (45° parallelograms)
- Cut diamonds using templates or 45° ruler
- Each ring requires 8 diamonds of the same fabric
- Cut corner squares and side setting triangles from background
- CRITICAL: Maintain consistent grain line on all diamonds
- Strip piecing method speeds up cutting and improves accuracy`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Lone Star:
- Build each of the 8 star points separately by joining diamond rows
- Join points in pairs, then quarters, then halves
- Set in corner squares and side triangles (Y-seams required)
- Press seams in alternating directions by row for nesting
- Work on a design wall to ensure correct color ring placement
- This is an advanced pattern — accuracy is essential`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Lone Star mistakes:
- Stretching diamond bias edges (star will not lie flat)
- Inconsistent seam allowances (rings won't align across points)
- Incorrect color ring sequence (breaks the radiating effect)
- Not pressing consistently (center becomes bulky)
- Rushing Y-seams when setting in corners (causes puckers)
- Cutting diamonds off-grain (causes distortion)`
