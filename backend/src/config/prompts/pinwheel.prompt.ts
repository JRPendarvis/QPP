  patternName: 'Pinwheel',
  
  characteristics: `Pinwheel is a dynamic spinning block made from half-square triangles:
- 2x2 grid of half-square triangles (HSTs)
- Each HST is divided by a single diagonal
- HSTs are oriented so one color forms "blades" spinning around the center
- Creates a windmill or fan effect
- NOT the same as Hourglass (which divides by both diagonals)
- When tiled, pinwheels can spin in same or alternating directions
- Simple construction with high visual impact`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Pinwheel specifically:
- 2 colors: COLOR1 blades spinning, COLOR2 background
- 3 colors: Opposite blade pairs share color, distinct background
- 4 colors: Blade pairs + background pairs for more variety
- 5-8 colors: Multiple pinwheel units in 2x2 grid, each using a color pair
- High contrast between blades and background creates strong spin effect
- Consider which direction you want the pinwheel to spin when choosing colors`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Pinwheel cutting specifics:
- Made from four half-square triangles (HSTs)
- HST method: Cut squares 7/8" larger than finished size, cut diagonally
- Or use the two-at-a-time HST method for efficiency
- Need two HSTs with COLOR1 on one side, two with COLOR1 on the other
- All HSTs must be identical size for points to meet at center`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Pinwheel:
- Make four HSTs first
- Arrange so blade color forms spinning pattern (all pointing clockwise or counter-clockwise)
- Sew HSTs into two rows of two
- Press seams in opposite directions for nesting
- Join rows with center seams nesting
- Press final seam open to reduce bulk at center`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Pinwheel mistakes:
- HST orientation wrong (blades won't spin — all must point same rotational direction)
- Confusing with Hourglass (pinwheel uses single-diagonal HSTs, not X-divided)
- Stretching bias edges (HSTs distort)
- Inconsistent HST sizes (center point won't meet)
- Pressing all seams same direction (won't nest, bulk at center)`
