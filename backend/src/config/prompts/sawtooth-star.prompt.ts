  patternName: 'Sawtooth Star',
  
  characteristics: `A Sawtooth Star is a classic star block with pointed "teeth":
- Four corner squares (background)
- Four flying geese units forming the star points
- Each flying geese has one large triangle (the point) and two small triangles (sky)
- All four star points aim toward the center
- One center square as the star's focal point
- Creates a bold, graphic star when assembled`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Sawtooth Star specifically:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Star points and center — the dominant visual element
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): Corner squares and sky triangles — frames the star
- For more dimension, use COLOR3 for the center square to distinguish it from the points
- High contrast between star and background makes the star pop`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Sawtooth Star cutting specifics:
- Cut four squares for corners (COLOR2)
- Cut one center square (COLOR1 or COLOR3)
- Flying geese: cut four large triangles for points, eight small triangles for sky
- Or use the stitch-and-flip method for flying geese units
- Corner squares are 1/4 the block width; center is 1/2 the block width`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Sawtooth Star:
- Build all four flying geese units first
- Arrange in a 3x3 grid: corners, geese, center
- Sew into three rows, then join rows
- Press seams toward the darker fabric
- Ensure all star points aim toward center before sewing`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Sawtooth Star mistakes:
- Flying geese pointing the wrong direction (star points must aim inward)
- Cutting off star points with seam allowances (use scant 1/4" seams)
- Low contrast between star and background (star disappears)
- Misaligned flying geese (points won't meet center cleanly)`
