  patternName: 'Storm at Sea',
  
  characteristics: `Storm at Sea creates an optical illusion of rolling waves or interlocking circles:
- Four small corner diamonds (nested diamond-in-diamond units)
- Four elongated side connector diamonds linking corners to center
- One large center diamond as the focal point
- All diamond units have a smaller diamond nested inside
- When tiled, creates the illusion of curved, undulating waves despite using only straight lines
- The "movement" comes from how the diamonds connect across block boundaries`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Storm at Sea specifically:
- COLOR1 (PRIMARY): Outer diamonds — creates the main wave structure
- COLOR2 (BACKGROUND): The "sea" — negative space that defines the wave shapes
- COLOR3 (ACCENT): Inner nested diamonds — adds depth and dimension to each unit
- High contrast between COLOR1 and COLOR2 strengthens the wave illusion
- COLOR3 should contrast with COLOR1 to make the nested diamonds visible`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Storm at Sea cutting specifics:
- Cut squares on point for all diamond shapes (or use diamond templates)
- Corner units: small nested diamond-in-diamond
- Side connectors: elongated diamond shapes (parallelograms)
- Center: large diamond with inner diamond
- Foundation paper piecing recommended for accuracy`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Storm at Sea:
- Build each diamond unit separately first
- Join corner units to side connectors
- Attach side connectors to center diamond
- Press seams toward the background fabric
- Accuracy is critical — small errors compound and break the wave illusion`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Storm at Sea mistakes:
- Misaligning diamond points (disrupts the wave flow between blocks)
- Inconsistent seam allowances (diamonds won't nest properly when tiled)
- Low contrast between waves and background (illusion disappears)
- Forgetting that the magic happens when multiple blocks are joined — always preview tiled`
