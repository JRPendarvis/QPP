  patternName: 'Strip Quilt',
  
  characteristics: `A Strip Quilt is a simple vertical strip pattern:
- Vertical strips of equal width running the full height of the block
- Number of strips matches number of fabrics provided (2-8)
- When tiled, creates continuous vertical columns
- Can be rotated 90° to create horizontal strips
- One of the fastest patterns to piece`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Strip Quilt specifically:
- All fabrics are treated equally — no background/accent hierarchy
- COLOR1 through COLOR8 fill strips left to right
- Consider arranging fabrics by value (light to dark) for gradient effect
- Alternating high-contrast fabrics creates bold stripes
- Similar values create subtle, blended appearance`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Strip Quilt cutting specifics:
- Cut strips the full length of the quilt
- Strip width = finished quilt width ÷ number of fabrics (plus seam allowances)
- Ideal for efficient long-strip cutting
- No crosscutting required`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Strip Quilt:
- Sew strips together along the long edges
- Press all seams in one direction
- For very long strips, pin frequently to prevent shifting
- Consider chain-piecing multiple quilt tops at once`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Strip Quilt mistakes:
- Uneven strip widths (creates wonky columns)
- Stretching bias edges on long strips
- Not pressing consistently (wavy seams)
- Forgetting that strip order determines the visual sequence`
