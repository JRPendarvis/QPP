  patternName: 'Churn Dash',
  
 characteristics: `A Churn Dash is a traditional nine-patch variation named for its resemblance to a butter churn dasher:
- Center square (1 fabric)
- Four rectangular "dashes" forming a plus/cross shape (1 fabric)
- Four corner half-square triangles (2 fabrics per corner, split diagonally)
- The accent color sits on the OUTER corner of each HST, creating a framing effect
- The background color fills the INNER triangles, connecting visually to the center
- NOT a simple nine-patch (corners are split diagonally, not solid squares)`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Churn Dash specifically:
- BACKGROUND: Best in the corner half-square triangles (alternating with accent)
- PRIMARY: Works well as the four "dash" rectangles on the sides - these are the most prominent feature
- SECONDARY/ACCENT: Best in the center square and alternating corner triangles`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Churn Dash cutting specifics:
- Cut squares for the center
- Cut rectangles for the four "dashes" 
- Cut squares then slice diagonally for the half-square triangles in corners
- Traditional Churn Dash uses high contrast between the dashes and the background`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Churn Dash:
- Piece the half-square triangles first for the corners
- Arrange in a 3x3 grid: corner HSTs, side dashes, and center square
- Press seams toward the darker fabric
- The "churning" effect comes from the diagonal splits in the corners`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Churn Dash mistakes:
- Using solid squares in corners instead of half-square triangles (makes it a nine-patch)
- Using four-patch units in corners (too complex, not traditional)
- Not enough contrast between the dashes and background
- Placing accent triangles on inner corners instead of outer corners (inverts the framing effect).
- Forgetting to alternate the triangle colors in corners`
