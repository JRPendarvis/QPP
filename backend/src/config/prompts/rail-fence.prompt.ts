  patternName: 'Rail Fence',
  
  characteristics: `A Rail Fence is one of the simplest strip-pieced patterns:
- Three horizontal strips of equal height stacked vertically
- Each strip is a different fabric
- When blocks are rotated (alternating 0° and 90°) and tiled, creates a zigzag or woven appearance
- Also called "Split Rail" or "Basket Weave" depending on layout
- The magic happens in the quilt layout, not the individual block`,

  fabricRoleGuidance: `For Rail Fence specifically:
- COLOR1 (TOP): Often the lightest value — creates visual movement when tiled
- COLOR2 (MIDDLE): Medium value works well — anchors the block
- COLOR3 (BOTTOM): Often the darkest value — grounds the design
- Arrange light to dark (or dark to light) for the strongest zigzag effect when tiled`,

  cuttingInstructions: `Rail Fence cutting specifics:
- Cut three strips of equal width in different fabrics
- Strip width = finished block size ÷ 3 (plus seam allowances)
- This is ideal for strip-piecing: sew long strips together, then crosscut into blocks`,

  assemblyNotes: `Assembly tips for Rail Fence:
- Sew the three strips together along the long edges
- Press seams in one direction
- Crosscut the strip set into squares
- Rotate alternating blocks 90° when assembling the quilt top
- Try different layouts: zigzag, basketweave, or random rotation`,

  commonMistakes: `Avoid these Rail Fence mistakes:
- Unequal strip widths (blocks won't tile properly)
- Forgetting to rotate blocks when assembling (loses the woven effect)
- Using fabrics with too similar values (zigzag pattern disappears)
- Inconsistent seam allowances (strips won't align across blocks)`
