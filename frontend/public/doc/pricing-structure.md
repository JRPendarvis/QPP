- Digital competitors: $15-30/month with limited features
- QuiltPlannerPro: $5.99-19.99 for unlimited AI-generated custom patterns

**Value Proposition:**
- Hobbyist tier = 1 pattern book per year in traditional quilting
- Enthusiast tier = 2-3 pattern books per year
- Pro tier = unlimited patterns (thousands of dollars in traditional patterns)

## Pricing Psychology

### Monthly vs Annual
- **Monthly:** Lower barrier to entry, higher churn risk
- **Annual:** Better LTV, lower churn, upfront cash flow
- **Target:** 30-40% annual adoption through discount incentive

### Tier Distribution Goals
- **Free:** 60-70% of signups (conversion funnel)
- **Hobbyist:** 20-25% of paid (entry tier)
- **Enthusiast:** 40-50% of paid (sweet spot)
- **Pro:** 25-35% of paid (power users, commercial)

### Upgrade Path
Free → Hobbyist ($5.99) → Enthusiast ($9.99) → Pro ($19.99)
Small incremental increases encourage upgrades

## Discount Strategy (Future)

### Potential Discounts (Not Yet Implemented)
- **Student discount:** 25% off (verify with .edu email)
- **Quilting guild discount:** 15% off groups of 5+
- **Annual discount:** Already built in (17-21% savings)
- **Referral credit:** $5 credit for referrer and referee
- **Black Friday:** 30% off annual plans
- **First month:** 50% off first month (acquisition)

### Never Discount
- Don't devalue the product with constant sales
- Maintain pricing integrity
- Use trials/free tier for acquisition instead

## Pricing Update Strategy

### When to Increase Prices
- After 1,000 paid subscribers (proven value)
- When adding major features (API, mobile app)
- Annual CPI adjustment (small increases)

### Grandfathering
- Existing subscribers keep their rate
- New subscribers pay new rate
- Builds loyalty and reduces churn

### Price Testing
- Test pricing changes on new users only
- A/B test $5.99 vs $7.99 for Hobbyist
- Monitor conversion rates closely
