# Refund Policy

**Last Updated: December 10, 2024**

## Our Policy is Simple

**QuiltPlannerPro (operated by T Top Quilts LLC) does not offer refunds on subscription fees.**

Due to the digital nature of our Service, you receive immediate access to AI-powered pattern generation features upon payment. All subscription fees are non-refundable.

## You Have Full Control

While we don't offer refunds, you have complete flexibility to manage your subscription:

### Change Your Subscription Anytime
You may **cancel, downgrade, or upgrade** your subscription at any time.

**All changes take effect at your next billing cycle:**
- You keep your current subscription tier and features until the end of your current billing period
- Changes apply starting on your next billing date
- You're charged the new rate (or nothing, if cancelled) on your next billing date

**This means:**
- **Cancel:** No charge next month, account becomes Free tier
- **Downgrade:** New lower price next month, lower tier features next month
- **Upgrade:** New higher price next month, higher tier features next month
